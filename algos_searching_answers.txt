1. What is a real-life scenario that uses linear search?

A. If you are looking through a hard-copy file of papers for a certain document, it would make most sense to look through it from beginning to end to find it
 
2. What is a real-life scenario that uses binary search?

A. Looking at the departures screen at the airport, you would likely start in the middle to see what city was there and based on the alphabet you would either look to the left or the right to find your destination and keep halving the area you are looking at until you find it.

3. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

A. 7 

4. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

A. 3

5. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A. Linear because it works with unsorted collections and binary search does not

6. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Explain your reasoning.

A. Binary search is more efficient when searching through large, sorted collections for the target item, so with a million items it would take a long time to go through the list linearly if we didn't have to - a binary search would be much faster because it starts in the middle and makes the collection of items to search through smaller and smaller until it finds the target item. 

// Programming Questions

1. You and a friend have set a wager to see who can find the word "Albatross" in the dictionary the fastest. Write a program to allow you to win the bet.

var dictionary = ["Albatross", "Alberta", "Albino", "Album", "Albuterol"];

let dictionarySearch = (arr, str) => {
  let low = arr[0];
  let high = arr[arr.length - 1];

  while (low <= high) {
    let mid = (arr.indexOf(low) + arr.indexOf(high)) / 2;
    mid = Math.round(mid);

    if (arr[mid] > str) {
      high = arr[mid - 1];
    } else if (arr[mid] < str) {
      low = arr[mid + 1];
    } else {
      return arr[mid];
    }
  }
  return "Not in the dictionary";
};
console.log(dictionarySearch(dictionary, "Albatross"));

2. You work at a pet store, and a child has asked you to net the only white-spotted goldfish from the fish tank. Write a program that will help you net the right fish.

let fish = ["angelfish", "white-spotted goldfish", "goldfish", "pufferfish"];

let findFish = (arr, target) => {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] === target) {
      return "Found the fish";
    }
  }
  return "Not the fish";
};

console.log(findFish(fish, "white-spotted goldfish"));
